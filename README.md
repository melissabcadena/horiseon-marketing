# Horiseon Marketing

## Description

In this assignment, our class was requested to refactor the code for the landing page of a fictional company, Horiseon Marketing. The assignment was to update the website to follow accessibility standards. We have done this by updating the HTML file with semantic elements and adding alt attributes to images. In updating these sematic elements, we also updated the CSS file selectors to ensure we did not alter the look and functionality of the webgage. By adding these items, we have enhanced the web page's search engine optimization and accessible for those using assistive technologies.
